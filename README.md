Generalise the creating of KML files for Google Earth using simplekml.
For getting the coordinates I have used geopy ... 

<b> Prerequisites </b>
<i> Some fundamentals of python </i>
<code>
	pip install geopy <br/>
	pip install simplekml
</code>


I am not getting the exact search results for the coordinates ... So incase u dont get the coordinates .. please try to manually get the coordinates and place in  code for kml file to be generated.

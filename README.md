**Location Identifer And Plotter**
Generalise the creating of KML files for Google Earth using simplekml.
For getting the coordinates I have used geopy ... 

 Prerequisites
=========================
Modules 
---------------------
<code>
	pip install geopy 
	</code>
<br/>
	<code>
	pip install simplekml
</code>


I am not getting the exact search results for the coordinates ... So incase u dont get the coordinates .. please try to manually get the coordinates and place in  code for kml file to be generated.

Next things to do : 

1. Create a shape file(.shp and dbf) from KML.
2. Try to make a line with the coordinates.
